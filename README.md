# Python_in_ESP32

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains various **MicroPython** programs developed for the **ESP32** development board.  
It showcases examples involving different **sensors** and **modules**, making it an excellent starting point for learning how to interface hardware with ESP32 using MicroPython.

## ✨ Features
- **MicroPython-based** development for ESP32
- Interfacing with a variety of **sensors and modules**
- **Beginner-friendly** and easy-to-understand examples
- **Simple uploading** using Thonny IDE

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 Devkit V1** (or compatible ESP32 board)
- **Micro-USB cable** (for programming and power)
- **Sensors and Modules used** (examples mentioned in this repo)

## 💻 Software Requirements
- **Thonny IDE** (Recommended for MicroPython development)  
  👉 [Download Thonny](https://thonny.org/)
- **Python 3.x** installed on your PC (required for Thonny to run)
- **MicroPython firmware** flashed to ESP32  
  👉 [Official MicroPython firmware download](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)
- USB drivers for ESP32 (e.g., **CP2102** or **CH340** based on your board)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Flash **MicroPython firmware** onto the ESP32.
2. Install and open **Thonny IDE**.
3. Set up Thonny:
   - **Interpreter**: MicroPython (ESP32)
   - **Port**: Select the COM port connected to your ESP32.
4. Connect your ESP32 board via USB.
5. Open and upload the provided example scripts to your ESP32.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each script demonstrates how to use different sensors and perform basic operations on the ESP32.
